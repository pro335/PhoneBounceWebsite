                             <p className="text-center">Call forwarding enables users to forward or redirect incoming calls to an alternate number. Studies have shown that over 50% of first-time callers in the UK fail to leave a voicemail if their calls arenâ€™t answered. Diverting your calls gives you maximum control, prevents your reputation from being compromised and returns clients.</p>
